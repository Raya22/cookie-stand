> ## Forms

An HTML form is used to collect user input. The user input is most often sent to a server for processing.
'form' has referred
to a printed document that contains
spaces for you to fill in information.

The `<form>` element is a container for different types of input elements.
The HTML `<input>` element is the most used form element.

An `<input>` element can be displayed in many ways, depending on the type attribute.


```html
<form>
  <label for="fname">First name:</label><br>
  <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname" value="John"><br>
  <label for="lname">Last name:</label><br>
  <input type="text" id="lname" name="lname" value="Doe">
</form>
```

Information from a form is sent in name/value pairs.



> ## List , Tables and Forms

The list-style-type property
allows you to control the shape
or style of a bullet point 

It can be used on rules that
apply to the `<ol>`, `<ul>`, and `<li>`
elements.


```html
<ul>
<li>Ophelia</li>
<li>To Music</li>
<li>A Dream for Winter</li>
<li>Vowels</li>
<li>The Drunken Boat</li>
</ul>
```

> ## Events
HTML event can be something the browser does, or something a user does.
JavaScript can be executed when an event occurs, like when a user clicks on an HTML element.

```html
<body>

<h1 onclick="this.innerHTML='Ooops!'">Click on this text!</h1>

</body>
```
